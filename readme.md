#### Todos/known issues: 
* Restart the game/clear the board
* store how many wins/losses in localStorage, and display them in the UI
* during the setTimeout that delays the browser's turn, ff a user clicks another square during this time, make it do nothing. 
* do something cooler than just an alert when the win condition is
